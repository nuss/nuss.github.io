This is the website of Stefan Nussbaumer, an artist, designer and cultural technologist, currently living in Vienna, Austria.

Starting off as a graphic designer some 20 years ago, at a time when a simple email could still cause excitement, I have constantly been trying to keep up with developments in modern media. Though I am continuing my free artistic practice (painting, electronic music) I have become a developer of websites and other software. Follow the links on this website to get a quick overview.
